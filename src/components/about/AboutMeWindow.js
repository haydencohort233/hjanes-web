      <h3>I am a ReactJS Developer</h3>
      <p>
        I started at <strong>Bay Valley Tech</strong> in Modesto, CA
        <br />
         for <strong>2 years</strong> for an internship opportunnity.
        <br />
        <br />
        During this time, I practiced <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>React</strong>, and <strong>MySQL</strong> through 
        lessons on Discord and assignments from platforms like <strong>Scrimba</strong> and <strong>Codecademy</strong>.
        I also contributed to <strong>Group GitHub Projects</strong> to experience working in teams.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since then, Iâ€™ve developed multiple test projects to expand my skills even further, if you wish to see more click below.
